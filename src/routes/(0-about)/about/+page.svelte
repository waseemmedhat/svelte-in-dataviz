<h2 class="mb center">About this project</h2>

<p class="mb justify">
	So, I came up with this way to escape tutorial hell and to do more practical stuff but without
	actually leaving the tutorials. This will be my way of practicing with Svelte, CSS, and data
	visualization.
</p>

<p class="mb justify">
	The main idea is to take the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/">official Svelte tutorial</a>
	and to apply each tutorial lesson on a dataviz-related topic. I have no idea on how to implement this
	into an actual project, but I took the leap to start anyway and see where the project will go from
	there.

<h2 class="mb center">Technologies</h2>
<ul class="mb">
	<li><b>Svelte</b>: what I'm here for.</li>
	<li>
		<b>SvelteKit</b>: I use it here mainly as a SSG with <code>adapter-static</code>, so I won't use
		any fancy features, just taking advantage of client-side routing and general project structure.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>CSS</b>: I almost used Tailwind for this project, but thought I'd try just vanilla CSS to
		maximize the learning I get out of this project
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>D3</b>: This is the de facto standard library for data visualization. It provides low-level
		features and utilities for building visualizations. It also has a DOM manipulation API similar
		to jQuery, but I will hand that over to Svelte.
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb justify">
	<i>Note:</i> The styling of this project (font, colors, etc.) is heavily inspired from the
	<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Official Svelte web page</a>, though I might not have done a great
	job at imitating the design.
